# Inline Comments for Code

**AGI.py Example:**
```python
import pyttsx3  # Text-to-speech conversion library
import speech_recognition as sr  # Library for performing speech recognition

# Function to capture audio and recognize speech
def listen_and_interpret():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
        return r.recognize_google(audio)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        return "I didn't catch that. Could you repeat, please?"

# Main loop for continuous listening
while True:
    command = listen_and_interpret()
    if 'exit' in command:
        break
    else:
        process_command(command)
```
